    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The CNN is a pre-trained model (resnet50), as described in the Preliminaries notebook, and I left this as is. The RNN is just an LSTM function which takes as input the embed size and hidden size. The torch.nn LSTM function is similar to the one in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf, so I kept it as is. Mistakenly, I tried a few different embed_sizes and hidden_sizes, including very small values, which never gave good results. Finally I saw in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf that they used a value of 512 for both embed_sizes and hidden_sizes, so I went with this and it gave much better results. More specifically, embed_sizes arouund a value of 200 had a hard time reaching a perplexity value of 1 by epoch 3, but when changed to 512 it consistently reached a perplexity value of 1 by epoch 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another mistake I made initially was having a batch size way too low, being a value of 10. This made the training too slow and sometimes it didn't get anywhere. Finding a better batch size essentially came down to trial and error, but I tried values 32, 64, and 100. 100 was too large, and 32 was better but overall the best value seemed to be 64. Finally, I mostly used intuition for the vocab_threshhold value, where anything less than 4 sounds too loose and anything over 5 sounds too strict. Between values 4 and 5 I chose 4 too keep the threshhold looser so that perhaps it could train more easily. Though this difference is probably not significant, perhaps a vocab_threshold value of 6 could have provided a greater difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the epochs, I usually only had it at 1 or 2 for trial runs of different architectures (primarily different parameters), just to gauge whether or not the architecture was doing good, without eating up too much GPU time. Once I felt better about a certain architecture, I would increase it to 4 or 5. Overall, especially for the final architecture, I found that epochs above 3 didn't improve anything and were essentially meaningless, so I kept it at 3 in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edit (attempt 2):** I didn't have the batch_size = True set in the lstm in the decoder model, which was incorrect. The reviewer said to fix this and rerun it, which I did but the results were still not good. I tried many other hyperparameters again with this, and nothing really gave a better result, typically causing the loss to decrease to almost 0 in just the first epoch signifying overfitting. I consulted the papers above again, as well as some questions in the FAQ knowledge page, and I ended up changing the batch_size to 128, and kept the other parameters the same. Finally, it seemed having a smaller learning rate helped fix the quick overfitting issue, so in the third notebook the results can be seen where when the model performed well it does seem to have learned something, but it is still not great. Perhaps a dropout is needed, or an even smaller learning rate (though this would increase the already long training times). Note I also stopped the model from training on the second epoch since the loss was headed to being too close to 0, which would just cause overfitting like it normally does. Early stopping is a method to prevent overfitting, so stopping early here made sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edit (attempt 3):** I'm not sure what the issue was on my second submission. There was just one error in my code from the first submission, which when fixed should have given me better predicitions in the next notebook, so I did that but even after trying multiple other architectures nothing worked. Regardless, in the second submission the reviewer suggested I set the vocab_from_file to be false to help with the overfitting, but it didn't help. This time I tried adding dropout layers, which is implemented in the final model here, though it also did not do anything. At this point it seems like nothing is really making a change to the overfitting issue, so perhaps something is wrong somewhere else. In any case, the predictions in the next notebook where the model performed well have more than one word, so you can see that it has learned something. In most cases however, the predicted caption is just one word repeated. I have consulted the knowledge page for many FAQ's, as well as some reference papers above, and it seems like everything is correct so I'm not sure what the issue is. Note I stopped the training below at epoch 2 since the loss was already less than 2, which is when overfitting starts to become an issue (and to save GPU time).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edit (attempt 4):** Finally got this to work. Previously I had x = self.embedding(captions) in the forward function for the decoder class, but once I changed it to x = self.embedding(captions[:, :-1]), removing the end tag and retraining it, it fixed the problems I was having. The only thing I changed was the learning rate in the Adam optimizer, where I previously had a very small learning rate, which was just too slow Hence, I used the default learning rate instead, which is similar to what the papers referenced above used also, and I got the expected loss of around 2 and perplexity below 10. In the next notebook, the results are shown, and you can see some examples where the model does in fact work, but in some cases the captions are not entirely relevant, as expected with just 3 epochs (in the referenced papers they trained for much longer). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I left the transform at its provided value. The CNN takes images of size 224x224, so the resize value of 256 and random crop value of 224 made sense here. The random horizontal flip is meant to help train the model to be stronger, however I did't see any need to change this variable. In fact, getting a reasonably working model here was hard enough as it is, perhaps removing or decreasing the proability of a random flip would have helped in initially findng a good model, and then it could be added back later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The suggested parameters above seemed fine so I went with this. It seemed like it would make sense to train all the weights in the decoder trainable since this is how we get our output. Also, the encoder uses the pretrained network resnet50, so the weights were already trained to some degree, and training them would increase run time which is already long. That being said, the final model I have does not work to well, so looking back maybe I should have tried to train other parameters, like in the encoder for example. (Although unfortunately, after my many mistakes and trial runs, I am now low on GPU hour)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Naturally I first tried SGD here, but it did not work too well. I also tried Adagrad but it did not work too well either. After many tries with these, I consulted the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf which suggested the Adam optimizer. This also did not work until I tried a smaller learning rate than what I was previously using. More specifically, I started using learning rates of .1, .01, and .001, all which didn't give great results. I found with the larger of these learning rates, the perplexity would go down to 1 by epoch 2, but it didn't always for each run (i.e. it was inconsistent). A learning rate of .001 was better but when I finally tried a learning rate of .0001 with the Adam optimizer, this is when the perplexity would go down to 1 consistently by epoch 3. After I saw this I tried the other optimizers with this learning rate but stopped the run on epoch 1 or 2 since it was seemingly not doing as good as the Adam optimizer in comparison (and it was eating up GPU time).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edit (Attempt 2):** Learning rates higher than 0.00001 caused the loss to go below 2 too fast, which seems to be an indication of overfitting. Thus this is the best learning rate so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edit (attempt 3):** Since results are supposed to be best when the loss is around 2, maybe an even smaller learning rate could results in the less being around 2 when the first or second epoch finishes (i.e. well-timed early stopping to prevent overfitting), but GPU hours are low. Also it seems a bit odd to have such a small learning rate as most successful attempts and recomendations that I saw in the knowledge page suggested a learning rate equal to the Adam optimizers default, which is much larger than what I have (so something else must be the issue). In any case, if GPU resources were unlimited then even smaller learning rates could be explored as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edit (attempt 4):** As mention in question 1, the only parameter I changed was the learning rate for the Adam optimizer, from 0.00001 to the default 0.001."

    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
